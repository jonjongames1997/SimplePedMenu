# How To Use

1) Go in game 

2) Hit F9 (by default) to bring up the menu then you should have a section for peds, vehicles, weapons, and more.

3) Select what you want and enjoy!

# Radio Options Use

* You must be in a vehicle with Music Audio turned on in Game Settings or have Mobile Radio option turned on to use this feature.
* 2 Radio Stations will not work (Blaine County Radio & West Coast Talk Show) when crossing the county line. RockstarGames hardcoded this. You just got to deal with it.
